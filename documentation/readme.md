## Foreword
> Welcome to the general purpose Discord bot framework made in [discord.js@12.5.1](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/12.5.1/general/welcome). As the primary author of this project and the documentation, I would like to thank you for considering using this framework for your discord bot. We have tried to make this as open-ended as we could. This is so you, as a user, can make all the actions and decisions you should need to. Included in our documentation is a thorough explanation of our custom cfg code system. This is a small and easy to use way of storing small command sets that you want the bot to do on it's startup. Make sure these are one-time use, as they won't run again until the next restart.
